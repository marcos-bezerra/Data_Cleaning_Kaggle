Como você pode limpar rapidamente a entrada de dados inconsistente? Neste curso, você aprenderá por que se deparou com esses problemas e, mais importante, como corrigi-los!\n","Neste curso, você aprenderá a lidar com alguns dos problemas mais comuns de limpeza de dados para que possa analisar seus dados mais rapidamente. Você trabalhará em cinco exercícios práticos com dados reais e confusos e responderá a algumas das perguntas mais frequentes sobre limpeza de dados.

Pode ser uma parte frustrante da ciência de dados, especialmente se você é novo no campo e não tem muita experiência. Para lidar com valores ausentes, você precisará usar sua intuição para descobrir por que o valor está ausente. Uma das perguntas mais importantes que você pode se fazer para ajudar a descobrir isso é:\n","\n","**Este valor está faltando porque não foi registrado ou porque não existe?**\n","\n","Se um valor está faltando porque não existe (como a altura do filho mais velho de alguém que não tem filhos), então não faz sentido tentar adivinhar o que pode ser. Esses valores você provavelmente deseja manter como NaN. Por outro lado, se um valor estiver faltando porque não foi registrado, você pode tentar adivinhar o que pode ter sido com base nos outros valores dessa coluna e linha. Isso é chamado de imputação, e aprenderemos como fazer a seguir! :)\n","\n","**Vamos trabalhar com um exemplo.**\n","\n","Observando o número de valores ausentes no dataframe nfl_data, percebo que a coluna \"TimesSec\" possui muitos valores ausentes:"],"metadata":{"id":"rUbju9utRNV5"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# look at the # of missing points in the first ten columns\n","missing_values_count[0:10]"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"iHXWf0VARDQ2","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1644760218398,"user_tz":180,"elapsed":10,"user":{"displayName":"Marcos Bezerra","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"03421485183376810074"}},"outputId":"c95bf1db-7db7-42eb-bde3-cac90cf85152"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["Date                0\n","GameID              0\n","Drive               0\n","qtr                 0\n","down            61154\n","time              224\n","TimeUnder           0\n","TimeSecs          224\n","PlayTimeDiff      444\n","SideofField       528\n","dtype: int64"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":10}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Observando a documentação, vejo que esta coluna contém informações sobre o número de segundos restantes no jogo quando a jogada foi feita. Isso significa que esses valores provavelmente estão ausentes porque não foram registrados, e não porque não existem. Portanto, faria sentido tentarmos adivinhar quais deveriam ser, em vez de apenas deixá-los como NAs.\n","\n","Por outro lado, existem outros campos, como \"PenalizedTeam\" que também possuem muitos campos ausentes. Neste caso, porém, o campo está faltando porque se não houve pênalti, não faz sentido dizer qual time foi penalizado. Para esta coluna, faria mais sentido deixá-la vazia ou adicionar um terceiro valor como \"neither\" e usá-lo para substituir os NAs.\n","\n","***Dica: Este é um ótimo lugar para ler a documentação do conjunto de dados, caso ainda não o tenha feito! Se você estiver trabalhando com um conjunto de dados obtido de outra pessoa, também poderá tentar entrar em contato com ela para obter mais informações.***\n","\n","Se você estiver fazendo uma análise de dados muito cuidadosa, esse é o ponto em que você examinará cada coluna individualmente para descobrir a melhor estratégia para preencher esses valores ausentes. No restante deste caderno, abordaremos algumas técnicas \"rápidas e sujas\" que podem ajudá-lo com valores ausentes, mas provavelmente também acabarão removendo algumas informações úteis ou adicionando algum ruído aos seus dados.\n","\n","**Descartar valores ausentes**\n","\n","Se você estiver com pressa ou não tiver um motivo para descobrir por que seus valores estão ausentes, uma opção que você tem é apenas remover quaisquer linhas ou colunas que contenham valores ausentes. (Observação: geralmente não recomendo essa abordagem para projetos importantes! Geralmente vale a pena dedicar um tempo para examinar seus dados e realmente examinar todas as colunas com valores ausentes uma a uma para realmente conhecer seu conjunto de dados .)\n","\n","Se você tiver certeza de que deseja descartar linhas com valores ausentes, o pandas possui uma função útil, dropna() para ajudá-lo a fazer isso.
